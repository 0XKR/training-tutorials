# .NET Training and Tutorials

This repository holds the content used to build the .NET getting started tutorials hosted at http://dot.net

## Organization

The content is broken up into high level groups by topic, initially covering
- C#
- ASP.NET

Within each content area, there are one or more *tutorials*.

Each tutorial consists of *lessons*. Each lesson should be a page detailing the concept being taught, along with sample code. Lesson and page may be used interchangeably when describing the tutorials. Lessons may be broken up into several *steps*. Each step and lesson should end with working code the user can run using a REPL, Visual Studio, or Visual Studio Code.

Lessons will include *tips* that will be tagged according to reader background, and eventually these will be displayed to readers who have indicated they have that background. For example:

### Tip (tags: vb)
The *static* keyword in C# is equivalent to *Shared* in Visual Basic .NET

Lessons will be written using markdown (Github variant). Lessons should link to other documents for specific tasks and API references. These should focus on helping the user follow through and understand the tutorial.
